CODE    Database
--------------------------------
mongoose.connect    ->  database create
model create        ->  collections
CREATE code         ->  Document

ORM - Object Relation Mapping
ODM - Object Document Mapping 

Schema -
the identies that all of them have the same user form of data's

Authentication - 
Validating the user before performing any tasks

Authorization - 
The roles that are assigned to specific users and accordingly they can perform the tasks

Server requests for the Authentication everytime we request for some task completion. 
Even if we have been authenticated before.

To overcome this problem we have a unique string created by the backend that is attached to the frontend after accepting the request and sending a response.
That string is used everytime (request attached with the unique string) the frontend tries to interact with the backend and remembers the Authentication of the user.
